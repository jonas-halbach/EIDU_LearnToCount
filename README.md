The white area will be used to store the items which are used to visualize different formations. By clicking one of the four buttons "Horizontal Formation", "Circular Formation", "Random Formation" and "Grid Formation" you start the rendering process of the selected formation. 

By typing values into the textfields "Width...", "Height..." and "Item Count..." you can specify the properties for the formation visualization.
